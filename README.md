"# imageProcessing" 

I'll try to gather code snippets by citing the developer for better understanding on issues which I find interesting and 
planning to fill the gaps at some points. 

So far, the topics are:

0_simpleHomography:
How to use homography ("h") matrix ? How to calculate it using OpenCv for given points and results of projection of individual pairs.

1_DLTCalculation: 
How to calculate "h" for given 4 coplanar point pairs and affine transformation matrix using least square ?

2_Superpixels:
How to use SLIC and other two algorithm and apply segmentation ? How to get segments one by one.
